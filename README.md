# EasyAccess
Easy to access notes for day-to-day data science tasks.
Hypothesis: Complicated, regular data science tasks (e.g. Object Detection, Text-to-Speech, Speech Recognition etc.) can be solved using ready-made solutions. Where good ready-made solutions are absent (one key area I identified is Topic Modeling), we can make handy libraries for EasyAccess.

Currently in progress: Topic Modeling library to combine the benefits of NLTK, scikit-learn, Gensim, BERT and XLNet embedding (from Higgingface PyTorch).
